Today I will show up my first project in machine learning and data science. the project is about developing a platform for new personnel in the hospital during the crises of the coronavirus. the first part of the project is to make solutions of easy access to information thus I developed a dashboard showing the daily confirmed, deaths, and recovered cases also added graphs for a better understanding of the case this was done with scrapping data from multiple sources (websites) moreover I tried to add online learning technique to predict corona outbreaks it's a polynomial features regularized with an elastic net regression model to avoid overfitting. and the second part of the project is an e-learning system to help doctors help new personnel to get knowledge about the pandemic
